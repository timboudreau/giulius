        <h1>Settings</h1>
        This package provides a general-purpose mechanism for key-value pair
        based runtime configuration.
        <p>
            Settings are composed from zero or more Properties objects.  While
            the {@link Settings} interface <i>can</i> be implemented directly,
            that is usually not the way this library is used.
        </p><p>
            This library enforces separation between writing settings and reading
            settings, based on the following observations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The code that <i>changes</i> settings at runtime is something
                that configures the application &mdash; it is not a routine
                activity at runtime</li>
            <li>A client mutating settings at runtime is almost always a bug</li>
            <li>Settings represent mutable state which may be accessed by any
                thread.  As such, any mutation requires a locking model, and
                coarse-grained locking models are less deadlock-prone.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Generally a singleton Settings object is created on application startup;
            if you are using the Guicy library, you can use Guice's &#064;Named
            annotation to request direct injection of settings values.
        </p><p>
            To create that singleton, use <code>{@link SettingsBuilder}</code> -
            it contains built-in methods to construct a Settings object which
            exposes all system properties, environment variables, resources in
            JARs at a given location on the classpath, resources generated using
            the &#064;Defaults annotation, and any other properties sources
            you care to pass to it.
        </p><p>
            For clusters and cloud deployments, a simple mechanism for remote
            sources of properties can be used:  Just add a URL to your
            <code>SettingsBuilder</code>.  As with passing Files, you can
            specify an interval for the system to re-load the settings.
        </p><p>
            In practice, the global Settings is usually constructed using
        </p>
        <pre>
Settings settings = new SettingsBuilder.createDefault().build();
        </pre>
        <p>
            If you are going to need to change settings in-memory at runtime,
            you may call
        </p>
        <pre>
MutableSettings settings = new SettingsBuilder.createDefault().buildMutableSettings();
        </pre>
        <p>
            (remember that the ephemeral layer overrides everything below it).
        </p>
        <h3>Where Settings Come From</h3>
        <p>
            If you simply called <code>new SettingsBuilder().build()</code> you would
            get an empty Settings object.  <code>createDefault()</code> provides some
            conventions for where to get settings, but you are free to use any or all
            or none of them if you want.  What it actually does is this:
        </p>
        <pre>
    public static SettingsBuilder createDefault() {
        File homeDefaults = new File(new File(System.getProperty("user.home")), "defaults.properties");
        SettingsBuilder b = new SettingsBuilder()
                .addEnv()
                .addSystemProperties()
                .addGeneratedDefaultsFromClasspath()
                .addDefaultsFromClasspath();
        if (homeDefaults.exists()) {
            b = b.add(homeDefaults);
        }
        return b;
    }</pre>
        <p>
            The <i>convention</i> here is to add all of the JVM's system properties and
            environment variables so they are available for injection.
        </p><p>
            After that, it adds the merge of all properties files on the <i>classpath</i>
            named <code>com/mastfrog/generated-defaults.properties</code> (these will
            be generated using the <code>&#064;Defaults</code> annotation).
        </p><p>
            After that, it adds the merge of all properties files on the classpath
            named <code>com/mastfrog/defaults.properties</code>.  This is so you can
            include hand-edited properties files in your defaults.
        </p><p>
            Lastly, it adds a file called "defaults.properties" in the user home directory,
            if such a file exists.
        </p><p>
            In practice, these make for a sane combination of locations to use - but you
            can create your own SettingsBuilder and customize it to taste.
        </p>

        <h2>Namespaces</h2>
        <p>
            Especially when working with existing code, you may have settings which
            you need to load from a properties file on disk for one part of the system,
            and others to load for another part.  It may even be that both of these
            involve the same key names, so they really can't be combined into one
            properties file.
        </p><p>
            Namespaces exist to solve that problem.  A SettingsBuilder can take a
            constructor parameter which is the name of a namespace it belongs to.
            If supplied, that will change the behavior of where the code will look
            for properties files.
        </p><p>
            Take, for example, this:
        </p>
        <pre>
        Settings s = new SettingsBuilder("wildcards").createDefault().build();
        </pre>
        <p>
            Since we are supplying our own name, it will use that when figuring out
            where to look in the classpath and home directory.  Specifically, the word
            "defaults" is replaced by what you passed.  So it will look in
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>com/mastfrog/generated-wildcards.properties on the classpath</li>
            <li>com/mastfrog/wildcards.properties on the classpath</li>
            <li>~/wildcards.properties in the user's home directory</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Giulius library provides a way to make use of this.  When you are initializing
            your Guice injector, you would do something like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
        Settings wc = new SettingsBuilder("wildcards").createDefault().build();
        Settings stuff = new SettingsBuilder("stuff").createDefault().build();
        Dependencies deps = Dependencies.builder().add(wc, "wildcards").add(stuff, "stuff").add(new MyGuiceModule()).build();
        </pre>
        <p>
            So how do you use different settings in different Java classes?  This is quite
            simple:  the <code>&#064;Namespace</code> annotation.  Simply annotate your
            class or Java package (via a <code>package-info.java</code> file) with
            <code>&#064;Namespace("wildcards")</code> and then write its constructor
            for injection normally.  Under the hood, the system will detect the annotation
            and use the Settings you passed with that namespace:
        </p>
        <pre>
        &#064;Namespace("wildcards")
        public class Server {
           private final int port;
           public Server (@Named("port") int port) {
              this.port = port;
           }
        }
        </pre>
        <p>
            So you can split your settings into different files for different parts
            of the system, and then just annotate classes with &#064Namespace to
            specify where to look for values.
        </p>
