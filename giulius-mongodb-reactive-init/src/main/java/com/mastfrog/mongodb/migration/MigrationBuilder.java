/**
 * Supports "migration" of data in MongoDB collections, generically. You pass
 * either a MigrationWorker or a type for a MigrationWorker, and it will be run
 * to completion before the database becomes available to the application.
 * <p/>
 * Note that if a migration may take a long time, you may need to set the
 * setting <code>mongo.list.collections.max.wait.seconds</code> to a high value
 * to ensure migration is complete before any collections are provided to the
 * application.
 * <p/>
 * Migrations support backing up objects which match a query to a backup
 * collection, and will restore the backup if any migration completes
 * exceptionally.
 * <p/>
 * You pass a name and integer version for each migration; these are stored in
 * the <code>migrations</code> collection which tracks what migrations have
 * already been run. Migration support will not re-run a migration which has
 * already been run successfully, so historical migrations are near-zero
 * overhead.
