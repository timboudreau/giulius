        <h1>MongoDB Guice Bindings</h1>
        This package provides simple bindings to MongoDB, using
        <a href="https://github.com/timboudreau/giulius">giulius</a> for loading
        the host and port and setting up Guice bindings.  This project
        does not attempt to do any kind of ORM stuff, but just makes working
        with MongoDB + Guice simple.
        <p/>
        The entry-point is the Guice module <a href="MongoModule.html">MongoModule</a>.
        You can pass a database name to its constructor, or it will try to
        extract the application's main-class name if the default constructor is
        used.
        <p/>
        Individual collections can be bound so they can be injected using
        <code>&#064;Named("someName") DBCollection</code> - you need to tell
        the <a href="MongoModule.html">MongoModule</a> what the mapping between
        collection names and names used in code is.  I.e. if you want to have a
        collection named "ttusers" injected when a class references
        <code>&#064;Named ("users") DbCollection users</code> then you would
        do:

        <pre>
new MongoModule("myDb").bindCollection("users", "ttusers")
        </pre>
        
        If no String database name is provided, MongoModule will attempt
        to figure out the main class name from the current call stack (if you
        wind up with weird database names like "execute", this is why).

        <h2>Creating Indexes and Configuring Collections</h2>
        Sometimes it is desirable to configure some aspects of collections at
        the time they are created.  For this purpose, you can subclass
        <code><a href="MongoInitializer.html">MongoInitializer</a></code> - 
        and have more than one of these if necessary.  This class has hook
        methods which are called before and after collections and databases
        are created, allowing you to customize the creation options for a
        collection (for example, to create a capped collection), or to 
        create indexes on a collection immediately after it is created.
        <p/>
        To use it, all you need to do is to bind them as eager singletons;
        <code><a href="MongoModule.html">MongoModule</a></code> has an 
        <code>add(Class&lt;? extends MongoInitializer&gt;)</code> method
        to facilitate that.
        <p/>
        Here is an example which sets an index on one collection, and ensures
        that another is created as a capped collection:

        <pre>
    static class Ini extends MongoInitializer {

        @Inject
        public Ini(MongoInitializer.Registry registry) {
            super(registry);
        }

        @Override
        protected void onCreateCollection(DBCollection collection) {
            switch (collection.getName()) {
                case "users":
                    collection.ensureIndex(new BasicDBObject("name", "hashed"));
            }
        }

        @Override
        protected void onBeforeCreateCollection(String name, BasicDBObject params) {
            switch (name) {
                case "cappedStuff":
                    System.out.println("Set up capped");
                    params.append("capped", true).append("size", 10000).append("max", 1000);
            }
        }
    }
        </pre>

    </body>
